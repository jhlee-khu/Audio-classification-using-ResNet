---
this project is aim to classifying audio datas in [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) using ResNet <br>
We crop every audio data to have 2 second length, and then convert to a mel-spectrogram. <br>
The baseline code of ResNet.py and main.py is [Pytorch-cifar](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar) by kuangliu.
